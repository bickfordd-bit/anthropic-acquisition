**Subject:** Execution Authority for Claude – 5-minute overview

---

Dario and Daniela,

I've built an interactive overview of an acquisition opportunity that solves a specific problem: giving Claude execution authority in regulated environments.

No PDF. No deck. Just a 5-minute, self-guided walkthrough:

🔗 **[YOUR-VERCEL-URL-HERE]**

Key components:
- Constitutional AI for reasoning (you have this)
- Execution authority for action (Bickford provides this)
- Tamper-evident decision ledger (provable safety)
- Production deployment (HVPE trading engine as proof)

The deal: $500M over 36 months, milestone-based.

If the framing resonates, the right next step is a 30-minute working conversation on architecture and integration.

Available this week:
- Tuesday after 9 AM PT
- Wednesday anytime
- Thursday before 12 PM PT

Best regards,
